# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I created this project as a way to document my learning of code, including HTML, CSS, and JS. As a result, we now have a website that demonstrates knowledge of the aforementioned languages, whilst within itself giving key notes of what was learnt. I learnt how to build the wireframe, design the user experience, and add functionality to the interface.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
